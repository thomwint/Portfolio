                    Hello, my name is Thomas Winters. I am originally from Tennessee where I studied mathematics at the
                    University of Tennessee.
                    When I graduated college, I decided to move somewhere different and chose Minnesota as my mom and
                    her family lived there. I have worked mainly in retail and hospitality moving from OfficeMax to
                    Applebee's
                    and then to Renters Warehouse. I enjoyed the people aspect of the jobs, taking care of them,
                    helping
                    them acquire and purchase what they wanted and so forth; however, there was a lack of motivation
                    from these positions that I could not find. I decided to look at what I wanted in my career and
                    this
                    lead me to looking at a coding boot camp. I joined the web developer boot camp at the University
                    of Minnesota as I felt this was exactly the challenge and motivation I needed. I get to be
                    creative,
                    logical and more importantly, I get to continue my ability to help others.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Besides my professional side, I enjoy reading, watching movies/television and have been really
                    committed on becoming more fit and healthier. My guilty pleasure is of course, YouTube. I never
                    understood the spiral of
                    YouTube until it took me for a joy ride one evening. Watching video after video about all sorts
                    of things is fascinating to me and can keep me occupied for hours. I have grown out of it lately,
                    but I used to love playing video games, more specifically, first person shooters. Used to be
                    a great stress reliever, but boot camp has kept me busy.
